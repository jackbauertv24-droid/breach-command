# Railgun weapon presentation

Asset ID: `weapon-railgun`

Additional production asset; requires the integration described in the shared guide.

Read [art direction](../ART_DIRECTION.md), [technical contract](../TECHNICAL_CONTRACT.md), [quality gate](../QUALITY_GATE.md), and [integration guide](../INTEGRATION.md) with this brief.

## Intended visual event

A brief coherent high-speed discharge with a thin transient trail, tight electrode flash and sharp penetrator impacts along existing hit targets. This is the visual package for `railgun`, tied to its current firing interval of 2.3 seconds. The tower model must provide an origin socket; effects cannot emerge from the tower center by default.

## Timing and composition

Flash under 0.08 s, fading trail 0.1–0.2 s; no lingering solid light saber. Show power through brevity and controlled recoil. Scale the effect relative to a 2.5 m tower and 1–3 m ordinary organism. Emphasize a readable origin, travel/direction if appropriate, and contact. Keep mechanical recoil separate from particles. Branch variations must support the corresponding tower brief without silently changing hit logic.

## Palette and material

Use realistic heat, mineral dust, sparks or restrained cool electrical/cold tones as appropriate. Brightness is localized and brief; no neon blanket, constant bloom or cartoon starbursts. Dark smoke needs enough translucency and contrast not to obscure selection.

## Deliverables

Provide source, required atlas/flipbook or mesh assets, sprite-frame metadata, timing curve, opacity/blend recommendations, attachment socket and impact variant list. Use `public/assets/replacements/weapon-railgun/`. Demonstrate repeated firing and mixed weapons in a mobile-sized view, not only one enlarged hero effect. Include at least three subtle randomized contact variants when relevant.

## Integration and acceptance

Current rendering uses trace lines/sphere flashes. A new effect adapter must follow `shot` events and simulation targets; cosmetic projectiles must not add damage. Cap particles and persistent trails during endless waves, recycle resources, and measure transparency cost. Reject missing origin/contact logic, visually claimed extra hits, opaque battlefield coverage and inconsistent scales.
