Asset ID: `feature-2`

Current export: `public/assets/models/feature-2.json`. This export is a placeholder; do not copy its shape as the art target.

Read [art direction](../ART_DIRECTION.md), [technical contract](../TECHNICAL_CONTRACT.md), [quality gate](../QUALITY_GATE.md), and [integration guide](../INTEGRATION.md) with this brief.

## Concept and tactical identity

An unstable mineral pocket that can be detonated tactically. Feature index 2; a selectable procedural map element with a one-use tactical interaction. It should invite recognition without looking like a bright collectible toy.

## Visual construction and vibe

An irregular embedded mineral vein with fractured crystalline inclusions and a small abandoned sensor tag; no cartoon explosive barrel or candy crystals. Use the same weathering and material grammar as the colony and basalt terrain. Integrate the ground contact naturally while keeping the selectable silhouette clear. All sides must work when rotated; avoid an attractive front with an unfinished back.

## States and animation

Provide intact, warning and depleted states plus a short dust/mineral burst. The current activation damages enemies nearby once; geometry must not imply ongoing fire damage. Deliver `inactive`, `activate` and `used` clips or state meshes where meaningful; document whether a clip is a loop or a one-shot. The renderer currently hides used feature meshes, so retained depleted states require explicit integration. Required anchors: `detonation_origin`, `fx_dust`, `selection_anchor` and a simple selection proxy.

## Surface requirements

Believable layered materials and localized wear; no baked sunlight, no uniform plastic specular and no oversized neon panels. Contact dust and scratches must match the surrounding environment. The surface must remain readable in both neutral and battlefield light.

## Delivery and scale

Proposed envelope: 3 m patch, irregular protrusions below 1.8 m. Provide GLB, source, PBR maps, efficient LODs, state/clip metadata and in-context previews under `public/assets/replacements/feature-2/`. Keep activation radius/gameplay unchanged unless separately requested. Record blocker geometry explicitly; visual bounds cannot silently diverge from navigation.

## Generation instruction and acceptance

Create an original detailed 3D map interaction asset for a realistic sci-fi mining colony, with the stated purpose, silhouette and before/after state. Show it mixed with rocks and nearby towers in both orientations. Reject a generic glowing object, a reused tower with only changed tint, or a prop suggesting an unimplemented gameplay action.
