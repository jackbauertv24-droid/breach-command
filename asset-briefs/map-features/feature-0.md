Asset ID: `feature-0`

Current export: `public/assets/models/feature-0.json`. This export is a placeholder; do not copy its shape as the art target.

Read [art direction](../ART_DIRECTION.md), [technical contract](../TECHNICAL_CONTRACT.md), [quality gate](../QUALITY_GATE.md), and [integration guide](../INTEGRATION.md) with this brief.

## Concept and tactical identity

An abandoned anchored signal station that can be restored into a vibration lure. Feature index 0; a selectable procedural map element with a one-use tactical interaction. It should invite recognition without looking like a bright collectible toy.

## Visual construction and vibe

A weathered coupling platform, visible reciprocating head and broken-but-recoverable power housing. Distinguish abandoned state from a fresh player-built lure. Use the same weathering and material grammar as the colony and basalt terrain. Integrate the ground contact naturally while keeping the selectable silhouette clear. All sides must work when rotated; avoid an attractive front with an unfinished back.

## States and animation

Restore to a measured ground pulse; the current game creates a vibration structure and hides this feature. Deliver inactive, activating and restored references without placing two overlapping models. Deliver `inactive`, `activate` and `used` clips or state meshes where meaningful; document whether a clip is a loop or a one-shot. The renderer currently hides used feature meshes, so retained depleted states require explicit integration. Required anchors: `coupling_contact`, `fx_vibration`, `selection_anchor` and a simple selection proxy.

## Surface requirements

Believable layered materials and localized wear; no baked sunlight, no uniform plastic specular and no oversized neon panels. Contact dust and scratches must match the surrounding environment. The surface must remain readable in both neutral and battlefield light.

## Delivery and scale

Proposed envelope: 2.4 m diameter, 1.6 m height. Provide GLB, source, PBR maps, efficient LODs, state/clip metadata and in-context previews under `public/assets/replacements/feature-0/`. Keep activation radius/gameplay unchanged unless separately requested. Record blocker geometry explicitly; visual bounds cannot silently diverge from navigation.

## Generation instruction and acceptance

Create an original detailed 3D map interaction asset for a realistic sci-fi mining colony, with the stated purpose, silhouette and before/after state. Show it mixed with rocks and nearby towers in both orientations. Reject a generic glowing object, a reused tower with only changed tint, or a prop suggesting an unimplemented gameplay action.
