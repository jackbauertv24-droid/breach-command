# Economy and status symbols

Asset ID: `resource-icons`

Additional production asset; requires the integration described in the shared guide.

Read [art direction](../ART_DIRECTION.md), [technical contract](../TECHNICAL_CONTRACT.md), [quality gate](../QUALITY_GATE.md), and [integration guide](../INTEGRATION.md) with this brief.

## Concept and purpose

Alloy, power, reactor integrity, wave, kills and record symbols.

## Design instruction

Simple precise industrial shapes with consistent optical weight; power is distinct from heat and integrity is distinct from repair. Numbers stay HTML text. Interface icons can be clean vector symbols even though the user rejected line-art/pixel-art as the game-world visual style. Do not substitute these UI glyphs for detailed 3D world assets. Keep icon stroke/fill density coherent and edges crisp at intended size.

## Deliverables and states

6 scalable glyphs with 24-unit viewBoxes and monochrome/active variants. Use SVG for functional icons, transparent PNG only where raster art is justified, and editable source. Include all subject filenames in `delivery.json` under `public/assets/replacements/resource-icons/`. Avoid external fonts/assets unless licensed and packaged; labels, counters and upgrade descriptions must remain editable accessible text.

## Mobile requirements

Show the artwork within actual readable controls, including at least 44 CSS px intended touch targets in the proposed interface revision. The artwork itself may be 24 px. Portrait/landscape adaptation cannot crop essential controls or require paused combat. Active, disabled and cooldown states must also differ in shape/value/text, not only hue.

## Acceptance and integration

Show normal-scale screenshots and monochrome comparison. Confirm every symbol remains distinct and doesn't depend on tiny inscriptions. Current interface is CSS/HTML; new art should be wired to those controls without hiding text or baking an entire interface into an image. Reject emoji substitutes, toy emblems, neon panels and unreadable microdetail.
