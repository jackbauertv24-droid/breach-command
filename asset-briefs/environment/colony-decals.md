# Colony industrial decal atlas

Asset ID: `colony-decals`

Additional production asset; requires the integration described in the shared guide.

Read [art direction](../ART_DIRECTION.md), [technical contract](../TECHNICAL_CONTRACT.md), [quality gate](../QUALITY_GATE.md), and [integration guide](../INTEGRATION.md) with this brief.

## Concept and atmosphere

Original unit identification and safety graphics that ground the military machinery in a coherent manufacturer language. The environment must support the detailed military/biological art direction and the free camera.

## Production specification

Small maintenance arrows, service plate frames, restrained hazard bands and original abstract equipment markings. Avoid real franchise symbols and illegible fake paragraph text. Show representative close detail and a normal battlefield view. Detail hierarchy must stay coherent with the reactor and towers; terrain should not compete with selectable units.

## Scale and delivery

1024² atlas, transparent masks, clean padding and per-decal UV rectangles. Deliver editable source, required runtime files, channel/packing notes, bounds or tile scale, provenance and preview evidence under `public/assets/replacements/colony-decals/`. Use the shared contract for file types, color spaces and metadata. If multiple modules belong to this kit, enumerate each module and its filename in the delivery report rather than presenting a single beauty image as the whole kit.

## Integration requirement

Use sparingly as authoring layers or merged materials; many live transparent decal draw calls are undesirable on mobile. Current simulation rules remain authoritative. New decorative surface features cannot imply or secretly create fixed paths, build restrictions or resource mechanics.

## Generation instruction

Create a production-ready original realistic sci-fi mining-colony colony industrial decal atlas using the physical forms and surface requirements above. Use restrained color and readable macrostructure. Deliver a usable asset package, not only a concept painting or a texture with baked lighting.

## Acceptance

Test continuity with neighboring surfaces, all-angle readability, visible tiling/repetition, alpha seams and texture density. Supply neutral-light and game-light previews. Reject generic primitive stand-ins, flat color, toy-like geology or effects that hide the battlefield.
